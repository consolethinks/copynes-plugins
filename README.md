# CopyNES Plugins
This is a collection of CopyNES plugins written for/adapted to WLA-DX assembler. I thought it could be useful for other people so I'm publishing these without warranty! I also included some basic scripts for building and cleaning.

## Building
Run `compile-plugin.sh` with the `.asm` file in parameter that you want to build. A corresponding `.bin` file will be output beside the source which is your finished plugin.

## Cleaning
Just run `clean.sh`. It'll get rid of all .bin files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

## Licensing
See LICENSE.md
